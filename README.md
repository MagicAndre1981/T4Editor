# T4Editor
Get it from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimMaes.t4editor).

Note that I made this extension for personal use, but decided to throw it online for whoever wants to use it. It was made for VS with dark IDE settings in mind.

Extension for Visual Studio that increases productivity when working with T4 templates, especially in combination with [T4Executer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimMaes.ttexecuter). Works on 2017, 2019 and 2022 versions.

## Features

- Highlighted T4 tags
- Set custom colors for different code blocks.
- Code completion for code blocks.
- Brace matching
- Outlining

## Configuration

- Set colors via `Extensions > T4Editor > Adjust Colors`
